# finger-controlled-mouse
A Python-based finger-controlled mouse project using computer vision and hand tracking

Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the completion of my Hand-Controlled Mouse project, built using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI! This project allows users to control their computer cursor and perform clicks using hand gestures captured via a webcam.

Hereâ€™s how it works:
ðŸ‘‰ Right Hand: Moves the cursor based on the position of your index finger.
ðŸ‘‰ Left Hand: Detects a click gesture when the thumb and index finger are brought close together.

This project was a fantastic way to dive deeper into computer vision, hand tracking, and automation. Itâ€™s amazing how a few lines of code can bridge the gap between physical gestures and digital interactions!

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
1. Python
2. OpenCV (for webcam feed and image processing)
3. MediaPipe (for hand tracking and landmark detection)
4. PyAutoGUI (for cursor control and click simulation)

Iâ€™m incredibly proud of how this turned out, and Iâ€™m excited to explore more applications of computer vision and gesture-based controls in the future.
